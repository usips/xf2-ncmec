<p class=3D"statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>Backup Preservation</cap-smal=

of the electronic communications sought in order to preserve those communic=
ations. Without notifying the subscriber or customer of such subpoena or co=
urt order, such service provider shall create such backup copy as soon as p=
racticable consistent with its regular business practices and shall confirm=
 to the governmental entity that such backup copy has been made. Such backu=
p copy shall be created within two business days after receipt by the servi=
ce provider of the subpoena or court order.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body">(2) Notice to the subscriber or customer shall =
be made by the governmental entity within three days after receipt of such =
confirmation, unless such notice is delayed pursuant to section 2705(a).</p=

<p class=3D"statutory-body">(5) A governmental entity may seek to require t=

its sole discretion such entity determines that there is reason to believe =
that notification under section 2703 of this title of the existence of the =
subpoena or court order may result in destruction of or tampering with evid=

ustomer or service provider.</p>

 such subscriber or customer may file a motion to quash such subpoena or va=

with written notice of such challenge to the service provider. A motion to =
vacate a court order shall be filed in the court which issued such order. A=
 motion to quash a subpoena shall be filed in the appropriate United States=
 district court or State court. Such motion or application shall contain an=
 affidavit or sworn statement=E2=80=94</p>

on a governmental entity by delivering or mailing by registered or certifie=

in the notice which the customer has received pursuant to this chapter. For=
 the purposes of this section, the term =E2=80=9Cdelivery=E2=80=9D has the =
meaning given that term in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body">(3) If the court finds that the customer has co=
mplied with paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, the court shall orde=
r the governmental entity to file a sworn response, which may be filed in c=
amera if the governmental entity includes in its response the reasons which=
 make in camera review appropriate. If the court is unable to determine the=
 motion or application on the basis of the parties=E2=80=99 initial allegat=
ions and response, the court may conduct such additional proceedings as it =
deems appropriate. All such proceedings shall be completed and the motion o=
r application decided as soon as practicable after the filing of the govern=
mental entity's response.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body">(4) If the court finds that the applicant is no=
t the subscriber or customer for whom the communications sought by the gove=
rnmental entity are maintained, or that there is a reason to believe that t=
he law enforcement inquiry is legitimate and that the communications sought=
 are relevant to that inquiry, it shall deny the motion or application and =
order such process enforced. If the court finds that the applicant is the s=
ubscriber or customer for whom the communications sought by the governmenta=

 communications sought are relevant to a legitimate law enforcement inquiry=
, or that there has not been substantial compliance with the provisions of =
this chapter, it shall order the process quashed.</p>
<p class=3D"statutory-body">(5) A court order denying a motion or applicati=
on under this section shall not be deemed a final order and no interlocutor=
