<div class=3D"paragraph">
<p>NCMEC=E2=80=99s Cybertip Reporting API is RESTful and provides the endpo=
ints listed below, relative to one of the base URIs indicated above.
For example, to submit a report, a reporter would construct a <code>POST</c=

A detailed report submission example is provided in a <a href=3D"https://ex=

<p>Open a report submission.
This is the first endpoint used to initiate the submission of a report.
Requests to this endpoint require a body containing a single XML document c=
onforming to the report schema.
A response from the server will indicate whether the report was accepted an=
d, if so, the ID assigned to the report.
Only one XML document may be submitted per request.</p>

<dt class=3D"hdlist1"><span class=3D"api-method api-method-post">POST</span=
><code>/upload</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Upload a file to a report.
A successful request to begin a report submission must have been made prior=
 to a request to this endpoint.
Requests to this endpoint require the report ID to which the uploaded file =
is to be associated.
A response from the server will indicate whether the file upload was succes=
sful and, if so, the ID assigned to the file.
File uploads are optional and may be made as many times as necessary for th=
e report.
There is no limit to the size of uploaded files.</p>

<dd>

A successful file upload must have been made prior to a request to this end=
point.
Requests to this endpoint require a single XML document containing the repo=
rt ID and file ID to which the file details are to be associated.
A response from the server will indicate whether the file details submissio=
n was successful.
File details submissions are optional and may be made once per uploaded fil=
e.</p>
</dd>
<dt class=3D"hdlist1"><span class=3D"api-method api-method-post">POST</span=
><code>/finish</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Finish a report submission.
A report must be finished after all report contents have been uploaded for =
successful submission.
A response from the server will indicate whether the request to finish the =
report was successful and, if so, the report ID and a list of file IDs asso=
ciated with the report.
Once a report is finished, additional files or file details cannot be added=
 and the report cannot be cancelled.
If a report is not finished by the reporter, the report is automatically de=
leted by NCMEC 24 hours after the date the report was opened or 1 hour afte=
r the last modification (file upload or file details submission), whichever=
 is later.</p>
</dd>
<dt class=3D"hdlist1"><span class=3D"api-method api-method-post">POST</span=

<p>Cancel a report submission.
A report may be cancelled by a reporter before the report has been finished=

report was successful.</p>
