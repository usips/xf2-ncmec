# NCMEC Toolkit for XenForo 2
Electronic Service Providers (ESP) are required to report instances of child sexual exploitation material (CSEM) to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) under [18 U.S. Code § 2258A](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2258A).

XenForo 2 lacks a robust toolkit for delaing with sophisticated predators intending to propagate CSEM. This is a serious threat to service providers.
